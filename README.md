## Beyond WWDC
I learnt to use a computer when I was in Grade 1.

Then in Grade 3, I started to code using Language C.

3 years ago, I learnt to make an APP on iOS and was willing to join some of the greatest developers in WWDC.

I truly love Apple. Every year, WWDC is on my Must-watch list. All my electronic products are Apple-made. I read Steve Jobs A Biography for 3 times. I really wanna be like him and change the world. He's one of my idol.

I have waited for years and now I am 13 and I am able to take part in the scholarship without guardians!!!
