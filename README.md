# FINISHED BUT NOT SUBMITTED
# 2020 Swift Student Challenge
The project is finished, but it looks truly awful. I do not want to publish such a project to WWDC.

Maybe next year, I am going to try our best and do a better job! 

## Frameworks
* SwiftUI
* SpriteKit

## About
It is a game about the medical workers during the COVID19.

Saying thank you to all of them!
